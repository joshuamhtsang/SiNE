# Open-source network simulation roundup 2024

February 27, 2024  \-  [2 Comments](https://brianlinkletter.com/2024/02/open-source-network-simulation-roundup-2024/#comments)

I updated the status of the open-source network simulation and network emulation projects tracked in this blog. I found no new projects to add to my lists in 2023 or early 2024. I also did not have to delete any projects because they all seem to have an acceptable level of support in 2024.

Hello, cloonix will very soon (before end of march) produce a version that runs inside a podman that is not root. The only root commands necessary in the preparation will be:  
sudo setfacl -R -m u:${USER}:rw /dev/kvm  
sudo setfacl -R -m u:${USER}:rw /dev/vhost-net  
sudo setfacl -R -m u:${USER}:rw /dev/net/tun

This because these 3 devices are used for the kvm emulation.
