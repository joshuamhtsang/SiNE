# SiNE Example: Vacuum (Free-Space) Link at 20m
#
# This example demonstrates free-space wireless propagation with:
# - Two nodes in vacuum (no obstacles or reflections)
# - 20m separation distance along X-axis
# - Direct line-of-sight path only
# - WiFi6 5GHz parameters (5.18 GHz, 80 MHz)
#
# This scenario is useful for:
# - Baseline link performance testing
# - Validating free-space path loss calculations (FSPL)
# - Comparing against theoretical maximum range
# - Benchmarking against scenarios with obstacles
#
# Expected behavior:
# - Free-Space Path Loss (FSPL): ~68.3 dB at 20m and 5.18 GHz
# - Received Power: ~-48.3 dBm (20 dBm TX - 68.3 dB path loss)
# - Noise Floor: ~-88 dBm (80 MHz, 7 dB NF)
# - SNR: ~39.7 dB (excellent link quality)
# - BER/BLER: Near zero with 64-QAM LDPC
# - Single LOS path, no multipath or reflections
#
# Usage:
#   1. Build the node image:
#      docker build -t sine-node:latest docker/node/
#
#   2. Start the channel server:
#      uv run sine channel-server
#
#   3. Deploy the emulation:
#      uv run sine deploy examples/vacuum_20m/network.yaml
#
#   4. Configure IP addresses (containers have no IPs by default):
#      docker exec -it clab-vacuum-20m-node1 ip addr add 192.168.1.1/24 dev eth1
#      docker exec -it clab-vacuum-20m-node2 ip addr add 192.168.1.2/24 dev eth1
#
#   5. Test connectivity:
#      Terminal 1 (node1 server):
#        docker exec -it clab-vacuum-20m-node1 iperf3 -s
#
#      Terminal 2 (node2 client):
#        docker exec -it clab-vacuum-20m-node2 iperf3 -c 192.168.1.1
#
#   6. Cleanup (removes containers and all IP configuration):
#      uv run sine destroy examples/vacuum_20m/network.yaml
