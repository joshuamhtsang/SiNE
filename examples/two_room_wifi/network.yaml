# SiNE Example: Two Room WiFi6 Network
#
# This example demonstrates a simple wireless network with:
# - A server in Room 1
# - A client in Room 2 (through a doorway)
# - WiFi6 5GHz parameters
#
# The server and client can communicate through the doorway opening
# in the dividing wall, demonstrating realistic indoor propagation.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Start the channel server: sine channel-server
#   2. Deploy the emulation: sine deploy network.yaml
#   3. Test connectivity:
#      - Server: docker exec -it clab-two-room-wifi-server iperf3 -s
#      - Client: docker exec -it clab-two-room-wifi-client iperf3 -c <server-ip>
#   4. Cleanup: ./cleanup.sh or sine destroy network.yaml
