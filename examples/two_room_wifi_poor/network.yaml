# SiNE Example: Two Room WiFi6 Network (Poor Link Quality)
#
# This example demonstrates a wireless network with degraded link quality:
# - Server positioned in back corner of Room 1 (away from doorway)
# - Client positioned in opposite corner of Room 2 (away from doorway)
# - ~11m diagonal separation with no direct line-of-sight through doorway
# - Signals must diffract around walls or penetrate concrete
#
# Expected behavior: Higher path loss, lower SNR, increased packet loss
# compared to the two_room_wifi example where nodes are aligned with doorway.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Build the node image: docker build -t sine-node:latest docker/node/
#   2. Start the channel server: uv run sine channel-server
#   3. Deploy the emulation: uv run sine deploy examples/two_room_wifi_poor/network.yaml
#   4. Test connectivity:
#      - Server: docker exec -it clab-two-room-wifi-poor-server iperf3 -s
#      - Client: docker exec -it clab-two-room-wifi-poor-client iperf3 -c <server-ip>
#   5. Cleanup: uv run sine destroy examples/two_room_wifi_poor/network.yaml
